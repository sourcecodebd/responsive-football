                    <h3>Neymar Jr</h3>
                    <div class="player-text">
                        <p>Neymar, in full Neymar da Silva Santos, Jr., (born February 5, 1992, Mogi das Cruzes,
                            Brazil), Brazilian football (soccer) player who was one of the most prolific scorers in his
                            country’s storied football history.

                            Neymar began playing football as a boy in São Vicente, under the guidance of his father, a
                            former professional footballer who remained a close adviser and mentor throughout his son’s
                            career. Having played street and indoor five-a-side football, Neymar joined Portuguesa
                            Santista’s youth team in São Vicente, and in 2003 he and his family moved to Santos. There
                            Neymar, who was already an impressive player, joined the youth academy of Santos FC (the
                            same club for which Brazilian football legend Pelé starred over the majority of his domestic
                            career). At age 14 he had a successful trial with Spain’s Real Madrid, and Santos had to
                            increase its spending to retain him.
                            Neymar—a slender-framed 5-foot 9-inch (1.75-metre) forward—was supremely confident on the
                            field, with excellent body control, quick reflexes, and explosive speed. He made his first
                            team debut with Santos in 2009. While playing with Santos, he averaged a goal every other
                            match and helped the team win the Libertadores Cup (the most prestigious South American club
                            competition) in 2011. Neymar’s many individual honours with Santos included the South
                            American Footballer of the Year title in 2011 and 2012.
                            In June 2013 Neymar signed a five-year contract with FC Barcelona after a trade with Santos
                            in exchange for €57 million (about $76 million), one of the most expensive soccer transfers
                            in history. Two years later he helped Barcelona capture the “treble” of a La Liga
                            championship, a Copa del Rey title, and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)
                            Champions League title. While Neymar was instrumental in Barcelona’s success from 2013 to
                            2017, totaling 105 goals in 186 games with the club across all competitions, he longed to
                            get out of the shadow of teammate Lionel Messi, one of the greatest players in football
                            history. As a result, in August 2017 he engineered a departure to the French club Paris
                            Saint-Germain (PSG) for a then record €222 million ($263 million) transfer fee. In addition
                            to being the new face of PSG, Neymar also became the highest-paid player in the world, with
                            a €45 million ($53 million) annual salary. He appeared in just 30 matches during his first
                            season with PSG, scoring 28 goals for the club before breaking a bone in his right foot.

                            Internationally, Neymar was considered for the Brazilian side that participated in the 2010
                            World Cup in South Africa, but he was ultimately not included on the squad. Instead, he made
                            his debut for the national team in August 2010, in a friendly match against the U.S., where
                            he scored his first international goal in Brazil’s 2–0 win. He scored four goals for Brazil
                            at the 2013 Confederations Cup, including one in the team’s 3–0 victory over Spain in the
                            final, and won the Golden Ball as the tournament’s most valuable player as well as the
                            Bronze Boot as its third highest scorer. Neymar starred for Brazil when his home country
                            hosted the 2014 World Cup, scoring four goals in five games before he was knocked out of the
                            competition with a fractured vertebra in the quarterfinals. Without the team’s most
                            important player, Brazil lost by a shocking 7–1 margin to eventual-champion Germany in the
                            semifinals. Despite his early exit from the tournament, Neymar won the Bronze Boot. At the
                            Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, he led the Brazilian men’s side to its first Olympic gold
                            medal, scoring the winning penalty in extra time of the final match against Germany. He
                            scored two goals at the 2018 World Cup but was as well-known for his many theatrical
                            embellishments of fouls during that tournament (Neymar was the most-fouled player in the
                            event) as for his on-field play. Brazil’s World Cup appearance ended with a quarterfinal
                            loss to Belgium.
                            Off field, Neymar experienced legal troubles. In 2012 a Brazilian court ordered him and his
                            father to pay substantial back taxes from 2007 to 2008. An appeal was denied in 2016, and
                            that year a Brazilian court additionally found Neymar guilty of having falsified documents
                            in order to avoid paying taxes on income received in 2011–13. The player and his father were
                            also called into Spanish court after an investment fund that had sponsored him alleged that
                            it had been defrauded during his 2013 transfer to Barcelona.

                            to Spain after FC Barcelona agreed to pay for his medical treatments.

                            There he earned renown as one of the greatest players in history, helping his club win more
                            than two dozen league titles and tournaments. In 2012, he set a record for most goals in a
                            calendar year, and in 2019, he was named Europe's Ballon d'Or winner for the sixth time.

                    <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo</h3>
                    <div class="player-text">
                        <p>
                            Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in Madeira, Portugal. He
                            plays as a forward for Italian club Juventus and the Portugal national team. Commonly known
                            as Cristiano Ronaldo or CR7, he is regarded as one of the best players of this generation.
                            He has won the FIFA Ballon d’Or five times, equalled only by rival Lionel Messi. Known for
                            his pace and physicality, Ronaldo plays on the left wing, but can play as a striker as well.
                            The Portuguese international has scored 555 goals from 749 club appearances till date.
                            Ronaldo signed with English club Manchester United in 2003 for a transfer fee of £12.24
                            million, becoming the first Portuguese signing for United and the most expensive teenager in
                            English football history.



                            He made his debut on 16th August 2003 against Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League, when
                            he came on as a substitute for Nicky Butt. He received a standing ovation as United won 4-0.
                            On November 1 2003, Cristiano scored his first goal for the club with a free kick in a 3-0
                            win against Portsmouth.



                            Ronaldo stayed at United for six years, during which he won his first FIFA Ballon d’Or
                            following a stellar 2007-08 season when he scored 42 goals from 49 appearances, winning the
                            league title, the league cup, European Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup all in the same
                            season.



                            He has scored 118 goals from 292 appearances for Manchester United.



                            Rise to Glory



                            Ronaldo joined spanish giants real madrid in the 2009/10 season in a then world record
                            transfer fee of £80 million. He was given the number 9 jersey and made his La Liga debut on
                            29 August 2009, against Deportivo La Coruna. Madrid won 3–2 and ronaldo converted a penalty.
                            He kept up his form and scored in four consecutive matches.



                            Even though Madrid failed to win any trophy during the 2009/10 season, Ronaldo scored 33
                            goals from 35 appearances and finished second in the FIFA World Footballer of the Year.
                            After receiving the number 7 jersey from Raul before the 2010/11 season, ronaldo scored a
                            personal best of 53 goals from 54 appearances, winning the European Golden Shoe for a second
                            time.



                            The next season ronaldo broke his past record, scoring 60 goals. His domestic performances
                            saw madrid winning the la liga with a record 100 points after four years. He scored 46 goals
                            in the league, scoring against all the other 19 teams throughout the season.



                            The 2012-13 season saw Ronaldo on the goal trail again, scoring 55 goals from 55
                            appearances. He won the Spanish Super Cup, and finished as runner up to lionel messi for the
                            FIFA Ballon d’Or.



                            The 2013-14 season was an important one for Ronaldo as well as madrid, when they won the
                            European Cup for the tenth time (la decima).



                            Ronaldo scored 69 goals from 59 appearances, his career best. His international performance
                            was impressive as well, with hat-tricks against ireland and sweden.



                            His performances led him to win the FIFA Ballon d’Or trophy for the second time. His 17
                            goals in the Champions League made him top scorer for the third consecutive year, and he won
                            the UEFA Best Player Award.



                            In the season 2014-15, ronaldo won the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup, scoring a
                            career best total of 61 goals from 54 appearances. He also won the FIFA Ballon d’Or for the
                            third time. He finished the Champions League with 10 goals, shared with barcelona duo Messi
                            and Neymar. He also won the Pichichi trophy and UEFA Best Player in Europe award for a
                            second time.



                            Real Madrid won the Champions league for the 11th time during the 2015-16 season, completing
                            La Undecima, with Ronaldo becoming the all-time top scorer of the competition.



                            He became the all time top scorer for Real madrid in the same year, finishing the season
                            with 51 goals from 48 appearances.



                            In the summer of 2018, Ronaldo left Real Madrid to sign for Italian giants Juventus.


                            Cristiano Ronaldo backed by talented youngsters in squad as Portugal aim for second
                            successive title. The defending champions are bringing one of their most talented teams in
                            years to Euro 2020, loaded with players who can support Ronaldo and make Portugal a
                            contender again.

                            The attacking forward was born in the city of Laguna Larga, Argentina on 15 November 1993.
                            Since the very beginning, Dyala was a dexterous footballer and gained a reputed position in
                            the Italian football club. He was the top assist provider in the 2014–15 from Serie A when

                    <div class="player-text">
                        <p>Mesut Özil is a German professional footballer who was born on 15th October 1988 in
                            Gelsenkirchen, West Germany.



                            He plays for English club Arsenal and the Germany national team.



                            Özil plays mostly as an attacking midfielder through the centre of the pitch, but can also
                            be deployed as a winger on either flank.



                            In 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012, Özil became the joint-highest assist provider. In
                            2005, Özil moved to the youth system of Schalke 04 and later moved to represent Werder
                            Bremen in 2008. In the 2009–10 season, Özil became the key playmaker of Werder Bremen.



                            Özil ensured his place among Europe's top young talents as he signed a deal with Real Madrid
                            due to his performances in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.



                            Özil agreed to join English side Arsenal on 2nd September 2013 and he continues for Arsenal
                            in the 2017–18 season, when he signed a new long-term deal with the Gunners.



                            He has scored 81 goals in the 485 matches he appeared for different clubs. Özil has been
                            called "assist-king" in the media, due to his creative ability and offensive prowess as a
                            playmaker.



                            In the 88 appearances he made for Germany national team, he managed to score 22 goals at
                            international level.



                            Özil's performances for Real Madrid during his first season were praised by media as he
                            finished the season with 25 assists which is the highest for any player in any major
                            European competition that season.



                            He was nominated for UEFA Best Player in Europe Award due to his fine form with Real Madrid
                            and German national team, in which he finished tenth, being the youngest player to feature
                            in the Top 10 and was also shortlisted for FIFA Ballon d'Or award.



                            Özil finished the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament as the joint-highest assist provider and was
                            named in the UEFA Euro Team of the Tournament which earned him two Man of the Match Awards.

                            left winger and an attacking midfielder. The left footed player currently plies his trade
                            for French club, Paris Saint Germain. Di Maria was a part of the 2014 FIFA World Cup squad
                            of Argentina and helped his country to the final where they were beaten by Germany. Di Maria
                            scored the only goal of the game during the round of 16 tie against Switzerland. He would

                            find a place in the starting eleven in the current 2016-17 season, he has eight goals and
                            six assists to his name in 25 appearances, most of which are from the bench.
